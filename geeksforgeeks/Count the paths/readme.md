Given a directed acyclic graph(DAG) with n nodes labeled from 0 to n-1. Given edges, s and d ,count the number of ways to reach from s to d.There is a directed Edge from vertex edges[i][0] to the vertex edges[i][1].

 

Example:

Input: edges = {{0,1},{0,3},{1,2},{3,2}}, 
n = 4, s = 0, d = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to reach at 
2 from 0. These are-
1. 0->1->2
2. 0->3->2

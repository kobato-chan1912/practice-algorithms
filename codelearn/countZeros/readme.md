Given two integers a and b, we write the numbers between a and b, inclusive in a list. Your task is to calculate the number of occurrences of the zeros

Example

For a = 10, b = 11, the output should be countZeroDigit(A, B) = 1
For a = 100, b = 110, the list will be [100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110] so the output should be countZeroDigit(a, b) = 12
